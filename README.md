## Info

### 1. Installing packages shows unmet peer dependencies for bootstrap

When running `yarn` or `yarn install`, it may show you these warnings:

```sh
warning " > bootstrap@4.3.1" has unmet peer dependency "jquery@1.9.1 - 3".
warning " > bootstrap@4.3.1" has unmet peer dependency "popper.js@^1.14.7".
warning " > slick-carousel@1.8.1" has unmet peer dependency "jquery@>=1.8.0".
```

Don't worry, we're just using `bootstrap` to import styles for `react-bootstrap`, so it's not necessary to install these unmet peer dependencies. The same applies to `slick-carousel` that's just here to import styles so `jquery` is not needed.
